In my garden, the best plants are the volunteers; plants that appear spontaneously and surprise me with their gifts.  They find their way to a soil that offers what they need and then they wait until the time is right and burst forth. So it is with GrowSocial.

In April of 2015, thousands of people from across the globe turned on their computers and joined Copenhagen Business schools’ MOOC for a class called Social Entrepreneurship. The students were a beautiful mix of hopeful hearts of all ages and circumstances who wanted to learn how they could help make the world a better place. Our first assignment was to introduce ourselves.

Cynthia Schaefer, who would eventually become the team leader, posted a simple, passionate introduction about urban agriculture and how small farming needed an infrastructure.  The response was immediate - people were excited about the potential of small farming and local food networks to create good on so many different levels. The conversation took off!
                </p>
                <p>

The course was a crazy roller coaster ride! We formed teams, we had assignments, and we quickly learned that the more we learned the more we realized we didn’t know a fraction of what we needed to know. 
                </p>
                <p>

 Gradually, a team emerged and we had 31 people from across the globe working towards creating a viable business plan for what would soon become GrowSocial. As the weeks progressed team leaders emerged and we began to see the potential of GrowSocial as well as the enormous challenge we had taken on.  We placed in the top ten of business plans for our class and then the real work began.

None of us had taken the course with the intention of starting a social endeavor, yet here we were. We still had day jobs and lives that needed our attention but the idea that we could bring to the world a platform that could do for local food and urban agriculture what Etsy had done for the small artisans and create good across so many spectrums was too compelling to turn away from.
                </p>
                <p>

 We knew that GrowSocial, when it became what we envisioned, would be the tool people needed to create stronger and healthier local food networks, to support all the amazing people across the world that were already living sustainably. We could help bring more people into the local food communities and networks. This would in turn encourage more people to participate in local food networks, creating healthier communities, positive environmental impact and higher profiles for sustainability.  We would find a way.

Heather Skoll was our team leader for marketing and nonprofit liaisons. Basically, that meant she did everything, even waking up at 5 am for a Google hangout when she was out west visiting her parents. We had enticed her to join us by pointing out the wonderful synergies between at risk youth and urban agriculture and all the good that could be done by putting the two together.  She was already doing a lot of work in the nonprofit arena in her home town or Toronto, Canada, including running her own nonprofit organization.  
                </p>
                <p>

We knew that GrowSocial could be a vehicle to help integrate urban agriculture and local food networks with nonprofits to create even more opportunities for communities to thrive.   Cynthia had already seen some great examples of how this served the community. In Davie, Florida there is a small, 5 acre farm called Treehugger Organic Farms. They have programs for the local chapter of the Autistic Society that give families a chance to experience the wonders of the garden. It’s a win-win and Heather could see that those kinds of things could happen all over the world if there was a way to facilitate those connections.  This was the seed of GrowSocial Foundation. That’s another story for later. Meanwhile, Heather helps us with everything from words to ideas and always seems to know someone who we can talk to when we get stuck.

Misha Verplak lives in Australia. He was our tech guy. Without him, we didn’t have much except a big dream and a lot of passion. Cynthia begged him to stay on and be our CTO.  We couldn’t even think of it without him.  He wore every hat we put on him and never complained. Project manager? Sure! Developer? Sure! Hey, help us with our Google docs? Sure! Editing, projecting costs, preparing spread sheets, answering silly questions…so far we haven’t found anything he isn’t good at.

Ahmid Daccarett was team leader of our research team. Well, actually, he was our research team. Trying to find out data to support our business plan was hard! How do you quantify the number of people who are participating in the local food economy across the world when there are no stats linking them all together? Anything we couldn’t find out we asked Ahmid.  He always found something to help us. He was living and working in Germany during the class but is back in his home country of Guatemala.

Financials! Who was willing to step into that black hole? Michelle Ang! Despite having no background in finance, Michelle stepped up to the plate and kept swinging until we got enough hits to get us started with some projections. Michelle is in the Philippines and helps run her family business. She jumped into every aspect and many were the nights that had her talking softly during our hangouts because it was late into the night for her and she didn’t want to disturb her family. 
                </p>
                <p>

So there we were. We’d placed well in the business plan competition but had no funds, a small team spread out everywhere and an unstoppable dream. What next?

                </p>
                <p>

Well, we sputtered a bit. We tried Crowdfunding, but spent $1500 on a video and over $300 to promote the Crowdfunding only to raise about $1800 that was almost all from friends and family that probably would have supported us without the Crowdfunding fees.  But we learned things! And we supported a local videographer and had a video that we could use for other things. One big thing that we learned is that when you are doing something as world changing as GrowSocial with so many components it’s a complicated message and hard to explain in a few words. 
                </p>
                <p>

There’s a reason why most startups are done by college students. It’s a lot of work!  We needed a lot of money to pay developers to get us off the ground. We had areas that we knew nothing about that we needed expert help or time to learn. We decided to dig into our own pockets and see what we could do. 
                </p>

Misha crossed the pond to stay in Florida for 2 months and work one on one with Cynthia and other members of the sustainable local community in Fort Lauderdale. He ate a lot of meals from the garden and immersed himself in designing the platform. We worked with graphic artists and spent endless hours on user stories so that every step of the user experience was designed to create a site that would allow the user to accomplish what they needed to do quickly, efficiently and get them back to what they really wanted to do. 
                </p>
                <p>

Through it all, we’ve tried to keep our South Florida community informed and engaged with what we’re doing. Ahmid stepped up to manage our Facebook page and Heather stepped up to manage our Twitter account.  We’ve gotten some great support from the local community and have Tom Carroll, a local permaculturist who is retired from the tech industry, and Filiz Durmaz, from the MOOC, also helping with the coding. We’ve hired some college students and we’re all still working from our own pockets. 
                </p>
                <p>

Here we are - a couple of weeks from the pilot. The pilot will be a very limited version of the final site and is designed to help us validate the concept and plan the order in which we develop the functions of the platform. From there we’ll continue to develop phase one.  Our hearts, our time and our wallets are fully in this. 
                </p>

How can you help?  If you have any skills you think we can use, email us from our page, <a href="http://www.growsocial.org">www.growsocial.org</a>.

                </p>
                <p>

We’re doing this because we believe it will serve us all and make the world a better place.  As Misha says, the difference that money makes is that we can do it a lot faster.  So, fast or slow we’re working every day to make GrowSocial the tool to help you make your corner of the world a little greener and healthier with a thriving local food economy.
